# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **Controls players can change**: `action("jump", [.key(.space), .button(.a)])`, then
  `action_pressed("jump")`, `action_axis("left", "right")`...; `ui_controls()` in a menu lets the
  player rebind each action (press the new key or button), and the bindings are saved. Rebound
  has a Controls page. An array of shorthand values (`[.key(.space)]`) now takes its type from
  the parameter it is passed to.
- **Several gamepads**: up to eight, each by its number (`gamepad_down(1, .a)`, `left_stick(1)`,
  `gamepads()`); without a number, any of them. Flight sticks and wheels: `joystick_button` and
  `joystick_axis` give a device's own inputs.
- **3D models**: `load_model` reads glTF 2.0 (.glb, or .gltf with its files): meshes placed by
  the scene's nodes, base colors, PNG and JPEG textures, vertex colors; `draw_model` draws one.
  `read_gltf` gives the model's data without the GPU (for collision, or to change it).
- **JPEG**: `load_jpeg`, and `load_image`/`load_texture` read JPEG as well as PNG (baseline and
  progressive, any color sampling, grayscale, CMYK).
- 3D draws the camera cannot see are left out (meshes know their bounding sphere).
- **Paths over a grid** (lib/game/paths.jo): mark cells open or blocked, then `path_step(grid,
  from, to)` gives the next point to walk to round the walls (and `path_distance`): for enemies
  in 2D (tiles) or 3D (the ground's x and z).
- **Point lights** in 3D: `point_light(pos, color, radius)` for a frame (muzzle flashes, glowing
  shots, lamps); up to 8 light a frame, the ones nearest the camera.
- One mesh from many shapes: `add_box`, `add_cylinder` and `add_sphere` add a shape's vertices
  to an array (placed by a transform, in a color) for `custom_mesh`: a level or a robot drawn in
  one call. `draw_mesh(..., in_front = true)` draws over everything else (a first-person
  weapon that would poke into walls).
- Cameras for 3D: `orbit_camera` (drag to turn, the wheel to zoom) and `fly_camera` (WASD and
  the mouse), with gamepad sticks too; `camera3d(cam)` uses one.
- **Debugging on Windows**: `sloppy build` writes a PDB beside the program, and programs have
  unwind tables, so Visual Studio, WinDbg and RemedyBG show Sloppy functions, lines and call
  stacks (break at a function or a line, step through the source).
- The build block's `icon` is the window's icon on Linux too (X11); `PROGRAM_ICON` has its bytes.
- **The interactive prompt on Windows** (`sloppy` with no file), as on Linux: an input that has
  errors, panics, crashes or is stopped with ctrl-c leaves everything as it was before it.
- **Music that plays while it decodes**: `load_music` and `play_music` (Ogg Vorbis), for long
  tracks: no wait when they load, and little memory (`load_ogg` still decodes a sound whole).
- **Fonts**: `load_font` reads TrueType fonts (.ttf, .ttc) into sharp text at any size;
  `set_font` chooses the one `text` draws with. Text is UTF-8 now: accented letters, quotes,
  dashes and the euro sign in loaded fonts (characters a font lacks show as ?).
- A function that assigns a global declared further down its file gets a warning (it changes
  that global; `let x = ...` makes the function's own). A top-level `x = 0` now runs where it
  is, like other initializers.

## 0.4.0

Games:
- **Rebound** (examples/rebound) is the example game now, in place of Lumen: a one-file arcade
  game where you turn a shield to catch turrets' bolts and send them back (chain blasts, bank
  shots, upgrades, a saved best score). Play it at sloppy-lang.org/rebound, or change it in the
  playground.
- A second tutorial, **Make an arcade game**: a small Rebound in eight steps (docs/TUTORIAL_REBOUND.md).
- **Ogg Vorbis**: `load_ogg` (music at a tenth of the size of WAV).
- **Sprite sheets and animations**: `sprite_sheet`, `animation`, `draw_anim`, and
  `load_aseprite` for Aseprite's JSON with its tags.
- **Tilemaps**: from text (`tile_layer`) or Tiled's JSON (`load_tiled`), drawn by what is on
  screen (`draw_tilemap`), with `tilemap_move` for boxes that stop at walls and floors
  (examples/tiles.jo).
- **JSON** (`parse_json`, `to_json`, and `get`/`at`/`as_*` that chain) and **base64**.
- Menus ignore input in the frame they open, so the key that opened one does not also work it
  (`ui_ready()` for a game's own keys).
- `arc` (part of a ring) and `melody_loop` (music that loops without a seam).
- The playground opens an example by link (`#example=rebound`) and has the files examples use,
  like icons.

Language:
- At the top level, assigning to a variable of a `use`d module (or the library's, like
  `ui_style`) changes it, as in a function; before, it quietly made a new variable.
- Enums are members of unions like other types (`E | str` could not hold an `E`), and `.v` and
  `.v(args)` work as arguments, also for a union parameter.
- A function literal in a call's arguments works in an `if`/`loop` header
  (`if xs.any((x): x > 2): ...`).

## 0.3.1

Windows: `sloppy watch`, crash reports, the software renderer. Saving (`save_data`), menus
(lib/game/ui.jo), program icons, itch.io zips, the first tutorial, and correctness fixes from an
outside review. Earlier versions: the GitHub releases page.
